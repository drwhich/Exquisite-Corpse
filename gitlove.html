            <p>I feel like I was lost before you, like data overwritten. But there you are, a backbone for protecting everything I do. Once we configured thing out, so that you and I were set together. And when things were initiallized, the real magic started. I committed with you over and over, every time I made a change, and you kept track of where I was, no questions asked. Well, maybe asking what exactly I wanted to make note of before the committment. With a simple push, everything was set, and would be for a long time. You help me branch out to explore new ideas, and if things don't work there, you help me find my way back to my roots.</p>

            <p>In technical terms, Git is a program designed to backup data and files, keeping log of previous versions of saved work.</p>

            <p>The program starts by use of terminal code, usually 'git init'. Before using things though, git has to be configured to the individual, including name and email. Easy enough, right? </p>

            <p>One of the biggest parts of using Git is commiting, using the 'git commit -m' command. After the -m is a space for a message, ideally some note about what makes each version you're committng unique so that it can be found easily.</p>
