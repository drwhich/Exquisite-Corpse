            <p>What fantastic places that you've taken me, to a world where I can find anything I could ever need. You've introduced me to a collaborative community, where people can create, build, influence, there for anyone to join. And they all love sass, which you take in so lovingly.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I knew that you were there for me, long before I began to appreciate it. You've helped me overcome problems I thought were impossible, with how open sourced you are.</p>
