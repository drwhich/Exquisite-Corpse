          <p class="fade">I know this is going to sound crazy, believe me, I wouldn't believe any of this if it hadn't happened to me. I was never one to get spooked by the ideas of ghost or the paranormal, hell, I didn't think any of it even existed. But it all changed that night.</p>
          <br>
          <p class="fade">It all started as an innocent enough night. Some friends had gathered together after a week of exams. We were all worn out, and had maybe a few too many drinks.</p>
          <br>
          <p class="fade">Now one of my friends, let's call her Jill, was always a scaredy cat, and with Halloween coming up, we decided to step things up with our normal pranks on her. We had found an old Oni mask in an antique store a few days earlier, and just looking at it was enough to give me the creeps. Even though it was made of wood, the thing almost looked real, at least as far as a depiction of an evil spirit can go. The mouth was twisted into a cruel smile, the skin blood red, but the eyes were the worst part. Though the eyes had holes so the wearer could see out of it, I swear the thing was watching us. I hated it, so it was perfect for the prank.</p>

          <p class="fade">I thought it was just me at first, but whenever I was in the room with the mask I felt the temperature drop. I had a feeling it was something about the mask - it had been giving me eerie vibes from the start. I knew my friends would think I’m crazy if I brought that up though. After some more time passed, I noticed goosebumps and chills on all my friends’ arms and legs. Our air conditioner was broken and it was a pretty warm night. There was more to this mask then any of us originally expected.</p>

          <p class="fade">As dusk passed and the night got darker I couldn’t resist being drawn to the mask while no one was watching. It scared the living hell out of me, I couldn’t just shake off its chilling presence anymore. I knew Oni was waiting for me in the basement. I couldn’t believe that before today I had never encountered a paranormal experience, and now it’s all happening so quickly. As I walked through the living room and into the kitchen everything was completely silent except for my breath. Normally the wood floor creaks very loudly as someone is walking, but not a peep came out this time. It’s as if the Oni mask wants to give me the illusion of surprise. It wants to make me think I can successfully sneak up on it, but in actuality it is the almighty one.

          <p class="fade">I turned on the basement light from the kitchen and walked down the stairs, but halfway down the stairs the lights cut out and the door slowly started closing behind me. I ran up the stairs pushing the door as hard as I could. A gust of wind blew past and the door slammed shut. Terrified of everything, I decided to look for a candle. I found a match in a cabinet, but just as I lit it I heard a noise come from behind me.</p>

          <p class="fade">I struggled to light my candle - but then I saw a faint glow across the room, though neither candle nor match was lit. I walked towards it, shaking in fear. There was no turning back now. I walked across the room and was struck with a mix of awe and terror as I saw the mask, glowing as if drenched in moonlight, sitting on a table. My arm reached out, much to my mind's protest, towards the mask. I picked it up and slowly it moved toward my face.</p>

          <br>
          <p class="fade">As, in fear, I put it on, against everything my mind was telling me, a gust of wind began to blow, the old, disty plates from the shelf fell and shattered on the floor, objects of all sizes flew around the room like a swarm of locusts, and when the mask touched my face I felt something dark and mysterious enter me, consume me, transform me from the inside.</p>
