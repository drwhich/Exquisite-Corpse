  <p>It all started as an innocent enough night. Some friends had gathered together after a week of exams. We were all worn out, and had maybe a few too many drinks.</p> </div>

   <div class="fade">
  <p>Now one of my friends, let's call her Jill, was always a scardey cat, and with Halloween coming up, we decided to step things up with our normal pranks on her. We had found an old oni mask in an antique store a few days earlier, and just looking at it was enough to give me the creeps. Even though it was made of wood, the thing almost looked real, at least as far as a depiciton of an evil spirit can go. The mouth was twisted into a cruel smile, the skin blood red, but the eyes were the worst part. Though the eyes had holes so the wearer could see out of it, I swear the thing was watching us. I hated it, so it was perfect for the prank.</p></div>

  <p>Typically, my friends and I get super excited about pranks. Especially towards Jill. However, instead of thinking about Jill's frightened reaction, something was bugging me about the mask. Where did it come from? Who used to own it? And what was the feeling I got when looking at it? The thoughts were never ending.</p></div>
  <br>
  <div class="fade">
  <p>I thought it was just me at first, overthinking things, but whenever I was in the room with the mask I felt the temperature drop. I knew my friends would think I was crazy if I brought that up, so I kept my mouth shut. After some more time passed, I noticed goosebumps and chills on all my friends arms and legs. Our air conditioner was broken and it was a pretty warm night. At this point I realized things may actually be wrong.</p></div>
</section>

<section>
  <div class="fade">
    <p>I wanted that thing gone, thrown away, maybe in a lake, burned, or broken into pieces. But it wasn't that easy. One friend, Alex, had seemed to develop a fascination with it. I dont' want to say it was like Golumn in Lord of the Rings, but that's the closest thing I can think of. The way he looked at the mask, almost with a deep longing, just staring at it for ages. Thinking back though, he was the first to put it on. That <i>thing</i> probably got to him at that point.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="fade">
    <p>And then it happened. I got home late Friday, working on a project, ready to collapse. After walking in the door, setting my stuff down, and I realized the room had been warmer than it was when I left. I didn't think much of it, until I realized the mask was gone. I began to worry, texting all my friends and roommates, seeing if any of them had put it somewhere. Everyone responded, except for Alex. I asked if anyone had seen him, but not even his girlfriend had heard from him all day. The panic set in. The way he had been looking at that mask, and the feeling it gave me, I knew it was bad news.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="fade">
    <p>We decided to spread out, check out his usual hangouts, make sure Alex hadn't decided to party too hard and didn't answer his phone. I went by his favorite bars, stores, parks, and had no luck. The sun was beginning to set, lights were coming on. We were having the idea of calling the cops, but I was going to make one last lap before giving up. How I wish I hadn't.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="fade">
    <p>It sounds cliche, but I found him, or should I say it, in an alley. I heard some commotion from behind a building, and felt like I was called to investigate. There was a figure, hunched over, but humanoid. But there was also that sound, something that will haunt me as long as I live. The slop[y sound, mixed with cruches, breaking, and chewing and slurping. Curiosity drew me closer, and then I saw the body. The snapping had been of ribs. I wanted to run, faint, and hurl all at the same time. And then the thing bent over it turned around. My mind was racing, as before me was the oni mask, but alive. Those eye, that cruel smile, the red skin, except it was more. The eyes burned, and reflected the light. Then the mouth, it opened. The mask opened it's mouth, and laughed. Whatever that thing before me was, it was no longer Alex.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="fade">
    <p>I fled, adreniline pumping like never before. Truth is, I don't remember much, I'm pretty sure I blacked out. Next thing I knew I was home. I haven't left in days, too afraid to leave. But at night, that laughter keeps coming back. Closer each night. I'm not sure how much longer I have.</p>

          <p>I thought it was just me at first, but whenever I was in the room with the mask I felt the temperature drop. I had a feeling it was something about the mask - it had been giving me eerie vibes from the start. I knew my friends would think I’m crazy if I brought that up though. After some more time passed, I noticed goosebumps and chills on all my friends’ arms and legs. Our air conditioner was broken and it was a pretty warm night.

          <p>As dusk passed and the night got darker I couldn’t resist being drawn to the mask while no one was watching. It scared the living hell out of me, I couldn’t just shake off its chilling presence anymore. I knew Oni was waiting for me in the basement. I couldn’t believe that before today I had never encountered a paranormal experience, and now it’s all happening so quickly. As I walked through the living room and into the kitchen everything was completely silent except for my breath. Normally the wood floor creaks very loudly as someone is walking, but not a peep came out this time. It’s as if Oni wants to give me the illusion of surprise. It wants to make me think I can successfully sneak up on it, but in actuality it is the almighty one.
          <br>
          <p>I turned on the basement light from the kitchen and walked down the stairs, but halfway down the stairs the lights cut out and the door slowly started closing behind me. I ran up the stairs pushing the door as hard as I could. A gust of wind blew past and the door slammed shut. Terrified of everything, I decided to look for a candle. I found a match in a cabinet, but just as I lit it I heard a noise come from behind me.</p>

          <p>I struggled to light my candle - but then I saw a faint glow across the room, though neither candle nor match was lit. I walked towards it, shaking in fear. There was no turning back now. I walked across the room and was struck with a mix of awe and terror as I saw the mask, glowing as if drenched in moonlight, sitting on a table. My arm reached out, much to my mind's protest, towards the mask. I picked it up and slowly it moved toward my face.</p>
          <br>
          <p>As, in fear, I put it on, a gust of wind began to blow, the old, disty plates from the shelf fell and shattered on the floor, objects of all sizes flew around the room like a swarm of locusts, and when the mask touched my face I felt something dark and mysterious enter me, consume me, transform me from the inside.
          <p>I was no longer me - I was the Oni.</p>
